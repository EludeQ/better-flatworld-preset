# Better Flatworld Preset

This tiny mod adds a new flatworld preset that is more representative of a typical overworld world.
An additional 'decorated' option adds features such as grass, trees, and villages to the preset.

As of now there is only one preset included in this mod. (Including its decorated variant.)
Suggestions for more are welcome!

Of course, you are permitted to include this mod in your modpack.
